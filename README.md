A fairly simple web app for managing the inventory of the Casino Party on the 2022 student party elections in the Lovassy László High School. The inteface is in Hungarian.

For backend, I used [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) and for frontend, I used [React](https://reactjs.org) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev).

The whole project was made in half a day, so it's not perfect, but it worked exactly as expected on student party elections and I won't be needing this anymore so I won't be updating it either.

# Features

 - Responsive design with a dark and a light theme
 - Admin login for item management (category management only on the pocketbase dashboard)
 - Realtime updates on both the admin and the public interface
